## NOV.21.2017 task:
1. Feature_manager
2. parameters
3. cmake
4. read para_Pose, ..., from data files.
5. clear ros dependencies.
6. para_Feature redesigned.
7. pre_integration// simplized version.
	send_imu() -> processIMU() -> IntegrationBase->push_back()
so maybe, I could just use processIMU to build pre_integrations stack.
to achieve this, I need:
	double dt; vector<Vector3d> linear_acc; vector<Vector3d> angular_velocity;
	acc bias and gyro bias
	
8. if wanna use pre_integration data directly, gonna settle down with jacobian and covariance.
now we are left with jacobian in integration_base.

## required inputs:
ric, tic: camera extrinsic with respect to imu

Ps, Vs, Rs, Bas, Bgs: navigation state.

// we get the following double arrays from above params(ric, tic, Ps, Vs, Rs,  Bas, Bgs)
// except para_Feature.
// in the optimization process, these are all we needed.
para_Pose, para_SpeedBias, para_Feature, para_Ex_Pose, para_Retrieve_Pose

integration base members:
 dt
 acc_0, gyr_0, acc_1, gyro_1;
 linearized_acc, linearized_gyro, linearized_ba, linearized_bg
 jacobian, covariance;
 noise18x18,
 sum_dt, delta_p, delta_q, delta_v
